   * - New feature or enhancement
     - Description
   * - APM error based troubleshooting
     - Quickly understand the root cause of an issue for a specific service without manually setting up index span tags, looking at other traces, or referring back to the service map.
   * - APM service centric navigation and filtering
     - Improves user navigation in Splunk APM for visualizing, navigating and filtering through services. Service Centric Views in Splunk APM is now more prominently featured on the landing page so users can quickly understand service health without additional click-downs in the product.
   * - APM service map redesign
     - Service Maps in Splunk APM help engineering teams to quickly identify error sources and latency in complex application environments. We’ve redesigned the service map in this release to make it easier for users to get a holistic view of a service in the context of the larger environment.
   * - GDI wizard updates for GCP
     - This latest release streamlines the setup of GCP integrations in Splunk Observability Cloud through an instructional setup guide. This new guide simplifies the process, making it more intuitive and user-friendly. It also provides an additional authentication option - Workload Identity Federation. 
   * - Synthetics excluded files
     - We are excited to introduce the Excluded Files feature for users to have flexibility in configuring what file types their browser tests will exclude from loading on a page. By excluding certain file types, users can prevent skewed analytics due to third-party services and individually test performance of a page with or without certain resources.
   * - Log Observer Connect search experience enhancements
     - * We’re releasing a new “cancel search” functionality to help users gain more control over their log queries by cancelling a log search whenever one is active, allowing them to eliminate workflow inefficiencies and reduce their SVC consumption as well as resource waste
       * We have expanded automatic mapping of the severity key to include more key and value names. This ensures broader compatibility, including OpenTelemetry field names, and reduces the need for custom alias creation.
       * We have added guidance in the UI to help you select the appropriate connection and indexes to sharpen the focus of your searches.s
   * - SSO default role
     - When onboarding new Splunk Observability Cloud users, admins who aren’t able to enable Unified Identity can now select what the default role will be assigned to users in the Organization (Non-Enterprise Customers: Admin & Power; Enterprise Customers: Admin, Power, Read_Only, Usage) for more control on user’s scope and privileges.
